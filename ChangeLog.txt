APOLLO TO-DO LIST

Bugs and Bug Detection:
2. Check that the metallicity, etc. are being computed correctly when there
   are fixed parameters.
3. Handling of radius vs. area in an ensemble (and in general).
4. Give absorption and scattering cross sections separate table sizes.

Pending Updates:
5. Implement Arthur's Planet_auto_4-models_exponential.cpp.
6. Implement Arthur's changes to output and plot both median and MLE values.
7. Implement and example Arthur's addition of cloud parameters and parametric
   T-P profiles to Plot Apollo.
8. Implement Arthur's contribution functions (once completed).

Cosmetic:
9. Reorganize the header file to handle public and private correctly.
10. Replace all example output files with up to date versions.
11. Update the inline documentation and README file. (Include any NOTES from
    the Change Log.)
12. Revise the code for clarity: less confusing names for some parameters,
    correct labeling of "cross section" vs. "opacity" and "aerosol" vs. "cloud"
    or "haze".
13. Create or modify an example file for Ensemble mode.

Aerosol and T-P Models:
14. Combine layer-by-layer and (multiple?) parametric T-P profile generation
    functions into a single pipeline.
15. Combine the various aerosol models into a single pipeline (with clear names
    for each model).
16. Add more cloud models, especially particle size distributions.
17. Set the cloud priors so that the cloud base cannot be deeper than the
    maximum pressure in the model.

Cross Section Tables:
18. Add an option to auto-detect the resolution of the input spectrum and
    sample the cross section files accordingly.
19. Convert the cross section tables to bin files and do direct lookup of the
    needed wavelengths.
20. Create lo-res opacity tables suitable to be added to the Github repository.

Input/Output:
21. Consider adding more command line arguments to MakeHaze and checking for
    bad inputs.
22. Add additional flexibility to Plot Ensemble.
23. Add an option to plot comparison or literature values to Plot Apollo.
24. Print some of the output in LaTeX formatting.
25. Re-evaluate specific mode spectrum generation. Would it be better to accept
    auxiliary input files like the photometric mode does instead of hard-coding
    all the JWST modes. Consider what specific mode options to include, if any
    since we don't have any other observatories. Clean up JWST mode file names,
    and add or delete appropriate files. Revise the AddNoise function based on
    the ETC or otherwise fix the inconsistencies.

Other Features:
26. Add options for reflection spectra.
27. Implement 2-stream radiative transfer for transits.
28. Let transits use an input stellar spectrum.
29. Re-evaluate appropriate usage of separate upper and lower error bars.
30. Add options to test for convergence on the fly for both emcee's
    autocorrelation and an additional stopping criterion to max_steps.
31. Implement BIC or other statistical tests.
32. Add an option to lnlike() to bypass the calculation of binmod and s2, and
    call AddNoise() to find goodness of fit for specific JWST modes.
33. Add parameters for flux calibration between bands.

APOLLO CHANGE LOG

v0.12.1
Fixed a bug in the "no-radius" normalization.
Fixed several problems with the binning and convolving functions.
Changed BinBands to accept 2D arrays and return flattened arrays regardless of
the number of bands.
Converted the whole code from dealing with wavenumbers to dealing with
wavelengths because that's much less confusing.
Fixed the delta-L handing, which was mismatched in wavelength v. wavenumber.
Changed the band handling to add a buffer around each band equal to the bonuds
on delta-L.
Added additional parameters to scale bands relative to each other.
Added comment lines to make the segments of the code clearer.
Changed the "End" parameters to output 4 decimal places.
Removed an extraneous newline from the Samples output file.
Fixed a bug in the parametric T-P profile calculation.

v0.12.0
Created new 'Ensemble' operating mode, specified at the command line. This
mode creates an ensemble of spectra varying any parameters that have the
keyword 'Ensemble' added to the end of their line in the parameter file. This
ensemble moves in steps of 1 standard deviation between the lower and upper
limits for each designated parameter and outputs the spectra (without error
bars, etc.) into a single output file. This subroutine also produces warning
messages and continue prompts if the ensemble is >1,000 entries and halts if
it is >10,000 entries.
NOTE: Ensemble mode currently produces full-res spectra only--no binning or
other post-processing.
Added the Plot Ensemble script to visualize the ensemble results.
Created new 'Manual' mode, specified by 'Spectrum Manual' at the command line.
This mode allows you to recompute the spectrum using different values of the
parameters and plots the result to the screen. Once the desired spectrum is
found, type 'n' to exit out of Manual mode and compute the 'Spectrum' outputs
as usual.
NOTE: Manual mode only works if a GUI-compatible backend for Matplotlib is
functional. This may not be the case on an ssh system, in which case a non-GUI
backend like 'pdf' must be used.
Changed the opacity table naming: h2only changed to h2, and h2 changed to h2he,
to match the actual molecules used.
Made h2he the default filler gas instead of h2 only.
Streamlined reading in the paramater file with less use of split().
Fixed a bug that caused deltaL to appear twice in the output file for a
parametric T-P profile.
Split the To-Do List and Change Log into a separate ChangeLog.txt file.
Minor updates to inline documentation.
Reduced the number of walkers in Serial model to the minimum to allow for
faster testing.
Corrected the initial assignment of logf.
Corrected the default value of lnf from 1.0 to -100.0.
Add a commented-out runtime-updating forward model plot and forward model
write-to-file to lnlike() for testing purposes.
Added likelihood/length-of-spectrum as an extra column to the samples output
file.
Wrote the retrieved values of 'End' parameters to the output file instead of
defaults.
Moved the mass calculation to the correct position near the beginning of
setParams() in Planet.cpp.

v0.11.5
Combined Planet_layer.cpp and Planet_auto.cpp into a single Planet.cpp (and the
relevant header and Cython files).
This also corrected numerous errors that were in Planet_auto.cpp, centered
around the Teff calculation.

v0.11.4
Removed unnecessary Cython output files from the tarball.
Fixed a bug that caused the likelihood function to return zero when not using
polynomial fitting.
Corrected the initial guess for logf.
Fixed a bug that made the error bars on the JWST noise model impossibly small.
Fixed an error in the calculation of C/O and [M/H].
Added a maximum mass parameter.
Added an exposure time parameter for JWST model observations.
Added Plot.Haze.py to the package.

v0.11.3
Fixed an index error in the derived parameter calculation.
Updated Apollo.run for the current Python environment on Discover.
Fixed a bug that returned the wrong derived parameters due to a mismatch in the
shapes of "chain" and "blobs".
Removed the defunct "usebands" flag.
Updated the documentation.
Fixed one of the error statements in Plot Opac.
Revised getTauProf() with correct formulas for w0 and asym and more intuitive
calculations.
Corrected the definition of asf in MakeHaze.
Fixed several problems with the haze handling in Planet_layer.cpp and
Planet_auto.cpp.
Added the correct rstar to the specific mode plot calculation.
Fixed several problems with the handling of lores in getFlux().

v0.11.2
Fixed an error that reversed the function of BinBands.
Allowed Lupu_alk into longer-wavelength retrievals.
NOTE: the Burrows_alk cross sections include zero opacity past 20 microns.
Added a minimum mass parameter. Default: 0.5 Jupiters.
Added a prior that requires the scale height of the atmosphere (based on T_eff)
to be less than 0.05 times the radius. This prevents gravity from going so low
that the code is unable to find a T-P profile that converges.
NOTE: This prior may need to be adjusted based on testing.
NOTE: All of the mass, radius, and gravity priors may need to be adjusted for
"super-puff" planets that are unusually low-density.
Tested the 2-stream T_eff calculation.
Added the functionality to fix the value of any input parameter by setting
sigma = 0.
Fixed a fencepost error with the abundance array.
Updated and verified the functionality of all of the plots.
Added the wavelength calibration parameter back into the spectral plots.
Changed the names of the specific JWST modes to the correct grism+filter
combinations.
NOTE: slashes are replaced with hyphens and spaces with underscores.
Cleaned up the JWST mode plot and fixed the normalization.
Made the JWST mode plot compute the full-width spectrum so that all of the JWST
modes will be covered.
NOTE: this is now limited to Spectrum mode only because Retrieval mode doesn't
compute the full opacity table for efficiency.
Added the correct Right Ascension and Declination into the JWST mode calculator.
Fixed the normalization of the spectrum plots.
Changed the specific mode names to the correct JWST gratings and filters.
Restored the functionality for an empty parameter file.
NOTE: Retrieval mode does not work without at least one variable parameter.
Fixed a bug that set nsteps wrong in Serial mode if it wasn't in the input file.
Fixed the plotting of the derived parameters in the waterfall plot.  (I think
this went wrong because I copied it from Plot Apollo, which works differently.)
Made sure the plotting functions execute with a nearly-empty input file.
NOTE: The plots may look weird or empty is one or more blocks is empty.
Cleaned up and updated the output parameter file.
Converted the remaining .py files to be Python 3 compatible.
Updated transFlux to work with the lores table.
Fixed a bug in transTauProf and updated it to work with the lores table.
Moved databin and dataconv to separate lines in the input file.
Allowed the 'Polyfit' and 'Bands' flags to be in either order.
Clarified the usage of the 3 degrading parameters.
Changed the list order of the parameters and matched the example files to it in
order to make it a more logical progression.
Updated the example files.
Removed unused variables from the C++ files.
Removed unused variables from the header files.
Tightened up and clarified the default hires table setting.
Trimmed the ends of the input spectrum if it goes outside the hires table.
Switched to astropy's "convolve" function, which handles boundaries better than
numpy's function.
Removed the now-defunct "fixed abunds" code.
Cleaned up the comments.
Removed Makespectrum from the .tar file.
Removed the defunct "Spectrum" parameter.

v0.11.1.1
Updated Apollo.run to work with the new Python environment on Discover.
Fixed the calls to binBands, binModel, and get_Teff with the correct parameters
for the new formats.
Fixed the importation of the MPIPool.
Fixed the order of imports.
Changed the default alkalis in the example files to Lupu_alk.
Fixed a bug in the handling of the radius in the plotting section.
Fixed a bug in the specific mode plotting setup.

v0.11.1
Updated the SLURM run file for the new login server.
Fixed a bug in that caused the waterfall plotting in APOLLO to fail to read the
derived parameters.
Added databin and dataconv to the output parameter file (rather than setting
then to 1).
Changed the output filenames in Spectrum mode to prevent overwriting Retrieved
mode results.
Added the hires and lores tables to the output parameter file.
Fixed a bug that overrode the hires parameter in the input file.
Incorporated Arthur Adams's edits to allow for fixed gas abundances that are
not retrieved upon.
Fixed some missed variable name changes.
Incorporated Arthur Adams's edits to include separate absorption and scattering
cross sections for aerosols.
Added the "streams" variable to the "switches" array, per Arthur Adams.
Fixed the "watercirrus" and "waterice" aerosol names.
Corrected a bug that made the plotting program not use the full chain in Serial
mode.
Upgraded from emcee v2 to emcee v3.
At some point, I futurized all the print statements, but I don't remember doing
it. This should still work with both Python 2 and Python 3.
Fixed a bug that used the wrong radius in some cases for the spectrum plots.
Added basic garbage collection to reading in the opacity files.
Removed "streams" as a function parameter.
Added the "Star_Spec", "Spectrum", and "Output_Mode" input parameters from
Makespectrum to APOLLO.
NOTE: "datain" replaced "obsfile".
NOTE: "outmode" is used for the specific JWST mode plots, not yet implemented.
Modified MakeHaze to compute all three haze tables more easily.
Reduced the command line arguments for MakeHaze to just opacities directory and
haze name.
Implemented Arthur Adams's "absorption", "scattering", and "asymmetry"
subdirectories in "Opacities."
Moved the molecular cross sections to a "gases" subdirectory in "Opacities."
Moved the incides of refraction to an "indices" subdirectory in "Opacities."
The commented-out "exit" command before the Planet object is created
disappeared at some point. I added it back in.
Switched the order of the dataconv and databin parameters in the input file to
reflect the order in which they're used in the code.
Completely rebuilt the band handling to be simpler and more effective. The code
will not automatically detect discrete bands in the observations, separate
them, and individually convolve and bin them before reassembling them. It will
also compute the model spectrum in these bands only to save time and will
continue to do polynomial fitting when required.
Removed the "usebands" parameter, as it will now be done automatically.
Reorganized the To-Do List.
Fixed a bug that caused readopac to fail to read the header line of the
opacity files in some instances.
Got the polynomial fitting working with the new system.
Incorporated the specific mode plotting from Makespectrum. It currently does
not work because 

v0.11.0
Heavy overhaul of the main code to fix the convolution and binning system,
simplify the code structure, and reconcile several different builds currently
in use.
Moved the non-MCMC functions at the beginning of the code to a separate file,
ApolloFunctions.py.
Split the likelihood function into two functions, one to compute the forward
model spectrum and one to compute the likelihood. This removes the need for
separate APOLLO and Makespectrum codes.
Removed the Apollo.Makespectrum.py code and incorporated its functionality
into APOLLO with the 'Spectrum' command line argument.
Added the required 'Retrival' command line argument to do retrievals. (Default:
'Spectrum'.)
Added functionality for APOLLO to automatically plot the best fit spectrum
along with the other plots.
Replaced the various instances of binning and interpolating spectra with the
correct procedure of convolving the spectrum to the desired resolving power,
then binning it to the desired sampling resolution, which may be different.
Changed a lot of the variable names to make more sense and be more consistent
in context.
Fixed a bug where the Teff calculation would use the hi-res opacity tables.
Updated the Readme file.

v0.10.5
Changed the T_eff calculation to use the algorithm specified in the input file
instead of automatically 1-stream. (It had been that way for speed, but this
was not needed.)
Changed the 2-stream calculation with an opaque cloud deck to split the layer
in which the cloud tops reside--setting the temperature of the "bottom" layer
equal to T(hmin) and scaling the optical depth to the fraction of the layer
above the cloud tops.

v0.10.4.4
Corrected a couple of array sizes in Planet_auto.cpp.
Modified the getProfile subroutine in Planet_layer.cpp to cut off the planet's
radius at 5 R_J if low surface gravity makes the profile fail to converge.
Made minor corrections to the Emcee 3 conversion.

v0.10.4.3
Completely rewrote the GetScaOpac subroutine to include he, h-, h2s, hcn, n2,
and ph3, to make it simpler overall, and to make it easier to add new
molecules. Verified outputs.
NOTE: h2 and h2only have molecular weights that differ by 15%, which may affect
the retrievals.

v0.10.4.2
Changed wavelength to wavenumber in the specific mode output file of
Makespectrum.
Wrote the "Streams" parameter correctly in the output parameter file.
Changed the "binned" spectrum in Makespectrum from interpolating to actually
binning.
Added the wavelength offset to the binned spectrum and specific mode plots in
Makespectrum. (Not the fullres.)
Corrected the mean molecular weight for h2only, h2, and he filler gases.
Corrected the labelling of the base pressure in the waterfall plot.
Prevented the imin, imax, etc. arrays from going outside the limits of specwave
due to rounding errors.

v0.10.4.1
Corrected the right ascension in the output file.
Fixed the handling of mu for the cloud deck.
Removed extraneous print statements from Planet_layer.cpp.
Removed the logbeta line from examples.resolved.dat.
Removed the wrong definition of wstart from Planet_layer.cpp.

v0.10.4
Added the parameter name to the "Out of Bound" message.
Fixed a bug in setting the bounds on the opaque cloud deck level.
Corrected reading of the filler gas.
Clarified the "Mass out of Bound" message and removed the blank line.
Fixed the formula for the smoothness prior, more strongly penalizing large
values of gamma.
Fixed a bug that caused the walkers to get stuck for parameters where the
initial guess is zero.
Fixed a bug that was failing to account for the wavelength offset.
Fixed a bug that specifically set the wavelength offset to zero.
Changed the headers in the opacity files from millibars to bars.
Cleaned up the distinction between the cloud deck bounds and the integration
range.
Cleaned up the conversion from bars to cgs.
Allowed the cloud deck pressure level to be in both "Basic" and "Clouds".
NOTE: The declaration in "Clouds" overrides "Basic".
Added the opaque cloud deck to the two-stream calculation.
Fixed a bug in the data binning that was causing bins to stretch across gaps
between bands.
Fixed a bug that made the error bars on binned data too large.
Fixed a bug in the data binning that wrongly divided the flux by the bin width.
Added the code to better handle the wavelength bins at the ends of bands to
APOLLO from Makespectrum.

Cleaned up and greatly simplified the spectroscopic mode calculation in Apollo
Makespectrum.
Added a plot of the spectroscopic mode to Apollo Makespectrum.
Added the remaining JWST modes to Makespectrum.
Added a check in Makespectrum to ensure the spectroscopic modes match the
computed wavelengths.
Fixed a bunch of problems related to getting the spectroscopic modes to work
right.
Simplified the handling of the specwave array in Makespectrum.
Harmonized the GetBins and GetBinnedSpec routines in APOLLO and Makespectrum.
Removed the minimum mass from the internal mass prior.
Changed the standard log(g) limits in the example files to 2.0 and 6.0. This
may exclude some "super-puffs" but will otherwise include all currently
observable planets without being unnecessarily wide.
Clarified the h- label on the command line when reading opacity tables.
Fixed a bug that caused the effective temperature calculation to crash with
cloud models 2 and 3.
Added an option to discard wavelengths between observation bands to reduce run
times. (Does not work together with the polynomial fitting.)

v0.10.2.1
Fixed the labeling of the x-axis in Plot Opac.
Fixed the Lupu_alk opacity files and verified them.

v0.10.2
Added the Plot Opac script to plot cross sections to check for differences.
Added documentation for Plot Opac.
Added the Output_Mode parameter that specifies a JWST mode or a filter function
for which to compute a spectrum or flux.
Updated and tested the JWST mode calculations in Makespectrum.
Tweaked the labelling in the spectrum fit plot.
Revised the To-Do list.
Recorded derived parameters for all samples, not just those with nonzero
probability.
Included all samples after the burn-in in the waterfall plots, correcting the
previous incorrect method.
Changed the radius output from Earth radii to Jupiter radii.
Corrected the notes on blob handling.
Added a section to Plot Apollo to print the uncertainties for the derived
parameters.
Added a "confidence interval" command line parameter to Plot Apollo.
Added "binned" and "fullres" spectrum files and best fit plots to the tar
archive.
Updates examples files with the "Opacities" parameter.
Added new Lupu_alk opacity tables (though still not fully verified).

v0.10.1
Finished a few missing haze cross section tables.
Added the pressure profile to the samples output file for layered T-P profiles
to allow them to be plotted correctly in Plot Apollo.
Heavy overhaul of the plotting subroutines in APOLLO to improve the waterfall
plots.
The probability function now computes the mass, C/O ratio, metallicity, and
temperature of the planet on the fly and passes them to the sampler as a blob.
The "Basic" waterfall plot now includes the four derived quantities with
correct labels. The "Gases" plot also has corrected labels.
Harmonized the plotting functions in Plot Apollo with those in APOLLO and
Makespectrum.
Added material to the README file about the various configurations needed to
run APOLLO on a cluster.
Modified the spectral fit plots to draw the observations as points with error
bars on top of the computed spectrum.
Created separate plots for the full-resolution computed spectrum and the
spectrum binned to the observations.
Added an option to choose a filler gas.
Set the limits in the corner plots to 99% confidence levels to cut out
outliers.
Corrected the hydrogen scattering opacity.
Fixed a bug that prevented the gas list from being passed to the Planet object
correctly.
Made the opacity table read-in subroutine print full filenames instead of
species.
Verified that the output of the code is identical to version 0.9.x when the
same format of opacity tables is used.
Added notes to the README file that include how to switch between Emcee 2 and
Emcee 3.

v0.10
Heavy overhaul of the opacity managing system with four sets of opacity tables:
1. NIR tables (nir), 0.6-5.0 microns at R=10000
2. MIR tables (mir), 5.0-30.0 microns at R=10000
3. Wide tables (wide), 0.6-30.0 microns at R=10000
4. Lo-res tables (lores), 0.6-30.0 microns at R=200, used to calculate
   effective temperature from bolometric flux.
APOLLO now reads in two sets of tables: the lo-res tables for effective
temperature, and automatically selecting the appropriate tables for the
spectral retrieval. The lo-res tables have been designed so that they add about
10% to the workload on a typical ground-based (e.g. JHK) spectrum.
This means that while APOLLO computes a hi-res spectrum over only the
wavelength range of the observations, it automatically computes a lo-res
spectrum over the full 0.6-30 micron range.
Effective tempearture is always computed with one stream.
The hi-res and lo-res tables must have the same dimensions in temperature and
pressure (as well as all molecules within each set).
The haze opacity is interpolated automatically instead of read directly from
the (internal) table, so it always uses the hi-res tables.
The new tables also extend to 4000 K instead of 3500 K.
The opacity tables now include a header listing the size and limits of the grid
in pressure, temperature, and wavelength space (assuming all of them are
logarithmically distributed).
Added H2-only, He, HCN, N2, and PH3 to the list of supported molecules.
The standard "h2" opacity tables are now H2+He instead of H2-only.
Added Mass, C/O, [Fe/H], and the corrected Teff to the "basic" waterfall plots
in Plot Apollo (direct APOLLO plots pending).
Fixed a bug that set the radius wrong in the best fit output file.
Increased the number of steps to 11 in Serial mode in case of rounding errors
to ensure that some samples output is produced.
Removed the "Spectrum" setting and wrange variable, which are replaced by the
new system.
Combined the integer "switch" parameters for MakePlanet into a single int array
argument.
Made the "Serial" override set printfull to True.
Stopped printing "Out of Bound" statements for the statistical "End" parameters
to make the output less unwieldy.
Set the default number of steps in Serial mode to 2. With printfull set to
True, this is all that is needed for testing.
Added gamma into the best fit output file where it had been previously omitted.
Added the C++ cutoff switch to Makespectrum.
Excluded samples that were out of bounds from the waterfall plots.
NOTE: This may not be the correct way to do it. I just needed to do it to
remove nonphysical Teff calculations. The full samples are still computed as
intermediate products. EDIT: It was wrong and has been changed in v0.10.2.
Cleaned up the output from the likelihood function test in APOLLO.
Added another cutoff switch to APOLLO, which causes it to test the likelihood
function once and then halt.
Reset the statistical "End" parameters in the best fit output file because the
parameters found by emcee prevented it from running. (Reason unknown. There
might be a stray log somewhere.)

v0.9.13.2
Cleaned up maketar.sh to prevent it from including extra files.
Corrected the H2 scattering cross section in Makespectrum.
Fixed the alkali metal opacities, which were wrongly multiplied by 10,000.
Removed the effective temperature calculation because it was a shortcut that
didn't work. A script to compute it correctly from the luminosity is pending.
Verified that the fencepost error in gamma appears to have resolved the hot top
of the atmosphere problem.
Fixed a couple bugs in the best fit output format.
Fixed a bug in the TP profile plotting in Plot Apollo.
Removed the minus sign in the best fit output format.
Fixed the order of indices in Plot Converge.
Changed the output of APOLLO to list the number of steps actually recorded in
the samples file. (This makes the Plot programs work better.)
Changed Plot Apollo to match the new format.
Corrected the labelling in Plot Apollo.

v0.9.13.1
Changed number of walkers to account for adding Teff to the table.
Added the parameter list to the samples file produced by APOLLO.
Made APOLLO create a new input file with the best fit parameters.
Added an option to print the full sample array instead of the last 10%.
Added code to Plot Apollo to print waterfall plots and improved the interface.
Added a line in the input file to specify the Opacities directory instead of
hard-coding it.
Added the Opacities directory to the arguments for MakeHaze.
Added the Plot Converge script to troubleshoot the movement of the walkers.
Modified APOLLO to print to the sample file step-by-step instead of all at once
to print partial data if a run crashes.
Used emcee blobs to correct and simplify the handling of Teff.
Corrected the handling of the radius prior.
Allowed the "Short" output flag to be in any position in Makespectrum.
Updated and cleaned up the README file.
Fixed a bug that caused walkers to initialize with gamma being too large.
Corrected the upper bound on gamma from 1 to 1000.
Corrected the header of the samples output file.
Corrected the radius handling in Plot Apollo and the waterfall plot in APOLLO
so that it uses the radius in Earth radii and not the cross section.

v0.9.13
Fixed a bug in the h-minus handling.
Added a switch to turn the polynomial fitting on and off.
Warning: polynomial fitting and binning of observations will not work at the
same time.
Changed the code to use a spectrum truncated by the extreme wavelength of the
observations so that the wavelength bins do not have to be in order for a
non-normalized spectrum.
Fixed a major bug in how the polynomial fitting is handled related to passing
it to the Planet object.
Streamlined the polynomial fitting process in general.
Created "short" versions of the eclipse and transit observation files that fall
entirely within the NIR range, and changed the example input files to match.
Fixed a bug that was causing the code not to evalute all of the observations if
they were out of order.
Made the code able to accept arbitrary observations and ignore those that are
outside of the model's wavelength range.
Changed the model binning to actual binning instead of just interpolation.
Added new and updated Rayleigh scattering cross sections.
Removed the extraneous GetFluxPerBin subroutine.
Changed the transit and eclipse examples back to the regular observation files.

v0.9.12.1
Fixed a bug that caused a crash when databin is set to 1.
Corrected output directory in example files.
Commented out print statements in the spectrum calculation loop to make the
output less unwieldy.
Fixed several bugs in the plot generation in APOLLO.
Verified APOLLO end to end in serial operation.
Fixed a fencepost error in the index for gamma.
Verified the observation binning.
Fixed an error in the output file names in Makespectrum.
Verified the short filenames.
Fixed a wavelength-wavenumber mismatch in the noise model.
Fixed output for the JWST modes.
Verified input stellar spectrum functionality.
Updated addNoise function calls in Makespectrum.
Added an example photometric filter option to Makespectrum with the
corresponding thruput function in the Filter directory.
Fixed a bunch of stuff to make the photometric filters work right.
Verified MIR functionality.

v0.9.12
Enhanced the code to work on MIR data (5-28 microns).
Added new MIR opacity tables for gases and aerosols.
Note: only uses one set of tables at a time. Automatically removes alkalis
from MIR calculations because the tables don't go that far.
Corrected documentation of the spectrum file format.
Added an optional parameter to import a stellar spectrum to the noise model.
Added an option to create short output file names.
Added an optional paramter to call AddNoise for a photometric filter with mode
number -1 and an optional parameter for the filter throughput file (required
for this mode). Returns the central frequency, flux, and noise for the whole
filter.
Created a source code directory.
Created a directory for the example files.
Corrected the example files to reflect the change in directory.

v0.9.11.1
New version to work on new computer and cluster at GSFC, and other updates.
Added bound-bound and bound-free H-minus opacity.
Modified setup.py to use the gcc-mp-9 and g++-mp-9 compilers used at GSFC.
Began working on Python 3 compatibility. Used futurize on Apollo.py, but it
appears that only the print statements have changed.
Fixed a fencepost error in defining the master opacity table.
Fixed a bug that was causing Teff to evaluate to zero.
Added the Plot.Apollo.py script, which bins and plots a retrieved spectrum
against observations.

Added code for APOLLO to automatically create waterfall plots and a plot of
the T-P profile.
Added an option to APOLLO to bin down the observations.

*******************************************************************************

WISH LIST

Add additional cloud models. This will probably be the top priority from this
    sub-list.
Add additional parametric T-P profiles.
Add additional molecules. H2-minus seems fairly important, but I'm not sure
    what else would be.
Add a chemical equilibrium code. Note: suppress reactions that are slower than
    the rotation and/or circulation timescale.
Make sure the 2-stream algorithm works with clouds. (Split the cloud
    absorption and scattering opacities, etc.) Note 1: need to set the optical
    depth to infinity if it is below an opaque cloud deck. Note 2: this is what
    Arthur Adams is working on.
Make opacity tables that extend 1% beyond the official edges of their coverage.

CHANGES NEED FOR 2-PART MODELS

NOTE: A better band-handling system could simplify this.
Implement a parameter for partial cloud coverage. Think about how many
    parameters I'll need to fit a cloudy and a clear model to a spectrum.
    But need to get single-component models working first.
Implement combined transit and eclipse retrieval. This may involve dayside and
    nightside atmosphere models, but the other part is that it will need to
    compute separate transit and emission spectra for each model.
Implement phase curve observations. Basically the same as partial cloud
    coverage: dayside and nightside models with the "partial coverage"
    parameter being the phase angle.
Implement separate evening and morning terminator models for transiting planets.

IDEAS FOR VERSION 2.

Break up the functions in APOLLO/Makespectrum and Planet_layer/Planet_auto into
    separate files to be imported to clean things up.
Create a single method to handle all of the spectroscopic mode calculations.
Combine Planet_layer and Planet_auto into a single Planet class.
Combine APOLLO and Makespectrum into a single code with options for its various
    functions.
Have the code recognize the specific parameters listed for particular
    parametric T-P profiles and cloud models and implement default values for
    missing parameters.
Have APOLLO create a retrieved spectrum file and best fit plot directly after
    an MCMC run, possibly with a separate spectrum-computing function and/or
    using blobs.
Clean up the wavelength v. wavenumber mess.
Change all labeling of "haze" to "aerosol."

*******************************************************************************

DISCARDED IDEAS FROM VERSION 1

Make the settings not depend on being on separate lines. Dropped for the same
    reason Python uses whitespace. I've seen what happens when it's not
    enforced (*cough* CoolTLUSTY *cough*), and it's an unreadable mess.
Allow extrapolation of temperature outside the table. Using the boundary values
    is probably pretty safe in pressure space. In temperature, I've got it
    covered for 75 K to 4000 K, and that will cover the actual region being
    probed for everything from Saturn to the top of the L-dwarf range. Plus,
    I don't particularly trust the temperature extrapolation.
Turn the APOLLO and Makespectrum codes into functions in a single script. Even
    though so much of the two codes overlap, it doesn't make sense with them
    being *functionally* so different, with one being an MCMC that must be run
    on a cluster, while the other is a spectrum generator that can be run
    locally.
Add the functionality to compute haze scattering directly from the indices of
    refraction. It's so slow that it doesn't make sense to add it to APOLLO
    directly, especially since I've cleaned up the interface for MakeHaze. A
    lot of the issues that motivated this idea tie into the issue of how to
    handle the opacity files more generally.
Have APOLLO create a retrieved spectrum file and plot directly. This doesn't
    work because the spectrum calculation is hidden inside the lnlike function,
    and emcee isn't designed to modify it.
Add a default T-P profile for "Parametric" atmospheres. This doesn't work
    because the T-P profile parameters are tied in with the parameter list
    length. By default, the code throws an error message instead.
Add a symbol for the average error bars on the spectral plots. Discarded in
    favor of plotting all of the error bars.
Make the code able to handle tables of different sizes in T-P space.
    Currently, it assumes the table for each species is the same size. (This is
    mainly if I want to implement things like Exomol and/or mix and match
    them.) This is a problem because for efficient memory handling and spectrum
    calculation, the tables need to be the same size and not interpolated.
Add an average error bar size symbol to the JWST mode plot. Discarded because
    the error bars are too small to be visible.
